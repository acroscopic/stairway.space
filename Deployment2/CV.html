                <h2> Presentations Given </h2>
                <h4>Quantum Information and CHSH Lectures, 4/9/25 and 4/16/25</h4>
                <p>These two hour long lectures were given to Dr. Souvik Das' quantum computing research group. They were given in two sections, the first was to provide the neccesary background knowledge to a mostly undergraduate audience with little to no experience in quantum information. The second was given a week later and expanded on the previous lecture, and was on the CHSH experiment. These lectures are outlined in my paper, which can be found on <a href="https://github.com/acroscopic/CHSH">Github</a> 

                <h4> Neural Networks for Parameter Estimation of Orphan Afterglows in Rubin and Roman Data, 5/17(?)/25 </h4>
                <p> This presentation was given at the Astronomical Society, Republic of China, (ASROC), at National Formosa University. I presented along with Krupa Pothiwala about orphan afterglows — gamma ray burst afterglows, without the gamma ray burst. Attending ASROC 2025 was my first experience internationally. I gained invaluable insight from my presentation and attendence.
