                    <p>
                        I have proposed, designed, and coordinated observational astronomy activities for students and the local community. These events were held at various locations, including local public schools, on-campus in various locations, and at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex. I have set up, managed, repaired, and monitored various telescopes and instructed fellow students and interested members of the public on how to use them. I have used a wide range of telescopes, including but not limited to simple refractors, 4-8 inch Newtonian reflectors, 8-11 inch Schmidt-Cassegrain reflectors, and 12 inch Dobsonian reflectors. I have experience with motorized telescopes, including polar and multi-star alignment. However, I initially trained on manual telescopes, so I'm equally proficient without motorized alignment. I have used these telescopes in public astronomy events with groups of up to 1,000 people while communicating the science behind the observations. Additionally, I was the project manager for the observatory's "Art Conservation Effort." I oversaw, curated, expanded upon, and handled the Observatory's History of Astrophotography collection.

                        During Summer 2025, I contributed to the Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglow Project under the supervision of Dr. Donald Warren. My work focused on improving the group's computational infrastructure. I implemented significant updates to preserve institutional knowledge, including reorganizing and expanding project documentation across Github repositories and Overleaf, and authored intructional sections on topics such as Git usage and working within high-performance computing environments. 

                        Alongside this, I streamlined the project's data storage by converting large simulation output into a modern, compressed file format. This reduced storage needs by over 85% while additionally improving accessibility and making the data easier to work with. I also developed Python tools to automate performance checks, evaluate model output and find hidden errors, and efficiently work with large parameter spaces. In the course of this work, the team was investigated a theoretical mismatch in the calculation of a coefficient commonly seen in the scientific literature. I managed to trace it to a subtle mathematical distinction as a possible resolution.

                        In addition, I presented our research at the Astronomical Society of the Republic of China (ASROC) 2025 conference in Taiwan, delivering an overview of the project's goals, methodology, and early results to an international audience of astronomers and professional astrophysicists.

General tasks included preparing tables for guests, serving food and beverages, assisting servers in table management and workload, and maintaining a clean working environment.

Along with preparing tables for guests, I also had to maintain a cash register, prepare drinks, and convey food orders to the kitchen. Working both jobs simultaneously and preparing to continue my education in Florida further assisted my time management by requiring high-efficiency multitasking in high-intensity environments.

                        The INFINITY Science Center is the NASA visitor center next to the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. While working as a museum host, I curated and presented STEM-related exhibits and activities to engage diverse audiences, from young children to eager adults to curious seniors. I have fostered scientific interest through education by operating technical equipment for demonstrations nicknamed "Random Acts of Science." The various demonstrations included 3D printers, advanced diving simulators, a Van de Graaff generator, a Tesla coil, and live animals to demonstrate biological principles, all while ensuring smooth and scientifically accurate demonstrations. I assisted in the organization and execution of educational events, such as school group tours and educational class preparations, to support hands-on learning for students. While working with school groups, I ensured safety and organization by managing check-in procedures and providing guidance during museum tours. I have given tours to groups ranging in size from 2-50 people. I founded, developed, and maintained the museum's library collection, contributing to the educational resources available to the public and staff. Part of my work involved maintaining the museum's natural biome boardwalk and supporting environmental education through citizen science initiatives by providing local environmental data directly to NASA. Additionally, I collaborated directly with Apollo 13 astronaut Fred Haise, supporting his public engagements and archival projects. I also coordinated donor engagement initiatives by curating correspondence for autograph requests tied to charitable donations.

                        As a teaching assistant for the Information Science Technology Program, I managed the CCNA networking lab by resetting switches and routers and arranging new hardware for students. I monitored the lab at night to ensure students had access to complete assignments following their schedules. During this time, I initiated and maintained servers, assisted students with lab work, and assisted professors with setting up educational resources. As a student worker for the Science Department, I helped set up science classes and labs, opened and set up scientific equipment, maintained clean lab environments, and assisted with student honors college projects and campus events.

                    <p>I gave three separate hour-long lectures on Quantum Information and the CHSH inequality. Each of these lectures were given to groups of about 5-20 students, each hosted by Dr. Souvik Das. The first two lectures were given in two sections, the first on providing the necessary background knowledge in quantum information and the second expanded on the previous lecture, and showed all of the related derivations of the CHSH inequality, Tsirelson's bound, and exhibited code running on IBM hardware for empirical evidence of the CHSH experiment. The final lecture was to a larger group and was a condensed version of the two more focused lectures, focusing on the basics of quantum information and introducing the CHSH experiment.</p>
