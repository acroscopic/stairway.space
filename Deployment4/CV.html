                    <p>
                        I have proposed, designed, and coordinated observational astronomy activities for students and the local community. These events were located at various locations, including at local public schools, on campus in various locations, and the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex. I have set up, managed, repaired, and monitored various telescopes, and instructed fellow students and interested memebers of the public on how to use them. I have used a various range of telescopes, including but not limited to simple refractors, 4-8 inch Newtonian reflectors, 8-11 inch Schmidt-Casegrain reflectors, and a 12 inch Dobsonian reflectors. I have experience with motorized telescopes, however I initially learned with a nonmotorized telescope, so I am highly proficient without the need for automation. I have used these telescopes in public astronomy events with groups of up to 1,000 people while communicating the science behind the observations. Additionally, I was the project manajer for the observators "Art Conservation Effort." I oversaw, curated, expanded upon, and handled the Observatory’s History of Astrophotography collection.

                <p>These two hour long lectures were given to Dr. Souvik Das' quantum computing research group. They were given in two sections, the first was to provide the neccesary background knowledge to a mostly undergraduate audience with little to no experience in quantum information. The second was given a week later and expanded on the previous lecture, and was on the CHSH experiment. These lectures are outlined in my paper, which can be found on <a href="https://github.com/acroscopic/CHSH">Github</a> 

                <h4> Neural Networks for Parameter Estimation of Orphan Afterglows in Rubin and Roman Data, 5/17(?)/25 </h4>
                <p> This presentation was given at the Astronomical Society, Republic of China, (ASROC), at National Formosa University. I presented along with Krupa Pothiwala about orphan afterglows — gamma ray burst afterglows, without the gamma ray burst. Attending ASROC 2025 was my first experience internationally. I gained invaluable insight from my presentation and attendence.
